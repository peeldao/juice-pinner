  "description": "Power Plant Industries is a luxury industrial lifestyle brand focused on onboarding creatives in Web 3 using an understandable tangible: streetwear. We believe in the artists first. As artists and builders, we are placing ourselves at the epicenter of culture, fashion, and technology — with a hyper-focus on creators and builders, IRL and in the Metaverse. We are intent on building the future of sustainable fashion while still utilizing technologies, and exploring concepts such as implementing solar power + fiber optics into clothing and HomeGoods. Power Plant aims to style and empower the digital nomads. Imagine if you could show off your portfolio in your palm (without the use of a cell phone!) or on your hoodie’s sleeve?",

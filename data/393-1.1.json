  "description": "We are gathering the fans to fund together the purchase of licensing rights to some of Tolkien's works for video-games, movies, merchandising and more.\n\nOur configurations are set that if we fail to acquire the rights, everyone can claim their money back, minus the transaction fees.\n\nDonating to the project gives you tokens, those tokens are going to have governing power on a delegate governance system for choosing what to do with such rights if we get them.",

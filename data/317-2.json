  "description": "Our team is currently working on the ‘YI’ world's first MMORPG (The First YI) with 2D graphics but having the classic,enjoyable, fantasy gameplay.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, there are three roles: warrior, Magian and Warlock. Players can gain the Game value growth and the more powerful equipment through PVE on the different maps and copies.\n\nFocus on PVP play in the middle and later stages, compete for the core city through the establishment of war alliances and obtain token revenue in the game.\n\nPlayers can also convert game data into NFT after matching the level and equipment requirements. They can own the inheritance of the gamedata in ‘E’ world and have more experience in different games.\n\nWe hereby sincerely seek financing support for the seed round, which needs about 300 ETH, so as to promote the product to complete the related development, including the design for the game material(interface/role/map/…), the GameFi design , Access blockchain.",

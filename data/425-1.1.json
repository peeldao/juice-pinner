  "description": "We will raise ETH to develop NFTs related to Musk and Dogecoin in the near future, and plan to develop 100,000 NFTs. The DAO aims to raise ETH in return for the $MaskDoge governance token. After the NFT was developed, part of it was released to donors as ETH:MaskDogeNFT=1:1000NFT, 10% was airdropped to the top 100 doge coin holders, and 10% was airdropped to OpenSea's famous works to support them in Dogecoin and Contributions made by NFTs. The remaining NFTs will be sold, and the proceeds raised from the NFT sale will continue to develop Musk and Dogecoinâ€™s space travels. If the sale exceeds expectations, we will repurchase the MaskDoge tokens.",

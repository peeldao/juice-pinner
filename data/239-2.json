  "description": "Decentralized dream-funding platform - \nNothing is more painful than a broken dream, a stolen dream, a dream never realized. \nDream Hunters is a mindset, a community of dreamers whose mission is, \"Building a world where everyone has the tools & support to make their dreams a reality.\" \nA true Dream Hunter never gives up, which is why we’ve paved a path for all dreamers to clearly visualise all their inner dreams. We believe there is a purpose to everyone’s life that must be discovered, aligned with, and prosecuted.  \nThe Dream Hunters community believes and acts upon the following principles:\n - Don't compete; in unity there is strength.\n - Distribute the opportunities you have; the ones you need will find their way to you.\n - Anything is possible if we help each other. \nBut we’re really just dreamers helping each other navigate life's obstacles and achieve our dreams.\n\n",

I can live and work and I got lucky enough in. life, but other are not and every here is becoming worst here in SoCal especially Los Angeles, I work in NFT and you can always find me on twitter or on my discord servers projects. I want to open this weekly food bank DAO to be able to collect every week any amount share with the holders and buy meals for the people on the street that they can not afford or can't find any help to keep surviving in this society. this is for sure a scrambled project but with a lot potential and all my love for the others. I don't expect anything for me only the believing that others cares about the rest lees lucky. I'm BLeo or @thesimpsonzpunk on twitter ",

  "description": "A community-impact wine shop This is our reimagining of what wine can be when it’s by us, for us. structured as a space that uses its resources with a broader vision of intersecting commerce, community, and education to achieve a total departure from how wine-related industries currently operate with the intention of creating broader intersectionality. Wine is political: we drink the fruits of someone else’s labor. wine prices, even at the retail level, are inaccessible to most – we want to subvert the context of retail exploring ways of implementing de-growth philosophies into our business. We are rethinking what a neighborhood bottle shop can be, and how we can utilize our relationships within multiple fields to be a community impact-based space and equally create a digital platform focused on sharing information on every wine that is carried in the shop in a fully transparent model with digital content from each winemaker that the public can utilize to their curiosity and educational desire.",

  "description": "The full name of WDN is Worker Decentralize Network. WDN is a new generation of blockchain work protocol that combines an entire network of purpose-built blockchains to distribute tasks to workers through a work system, allowing them to scale seamlessly Collaborative work. Because WDN allows any type of data task to be sent between any type of blockchain, it unlocks a plethora of real-world scenarios. By combining results from multiple task networks, it will pave the way for the emergence of a Web 3.0 marketplace, giving various applications and providers a more equitable way to obtain and share data. Although the current layer1 or layer2 protocol network shows great potential in various fields such as Internet of Things (IoT), finance, governance, identity management network decentralization and asset tracking, in the current blockchain network, due to each layer protocol The design constraints of the network have largely hindered its mass adoption of shared data. \nCompared with the existing main chain protocol network, the design of WDN provides several solutions, including SMS (Share Mission System),AG (Action Group),RPS (Reward Proof System),AMS (Aggregate Market System)andVPS (Voting Proposal System).",

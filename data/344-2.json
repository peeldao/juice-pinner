  "description": "E Pluribus Unum\nOut of many, ONE.\nWe are gonna buy the Constitution* (ðŸ“œ, ðŸ“œ)\n(* or try to at least, not the actual Constitution, but a copy of an original print that's going up for auction... and when we win, it will be governed by the people.)\nMission\nExclusive institutions and collectors control some of the world's most important civic artifacts. We aim to bring these artifacts under a Web3 decentralized governance model. Rather than burying the artifacts away in private vaults our goal is to ensure the objects which were designed \"for the people\" are returned to the people, increasing public access, and allowing everyone to learn from the history and values.\nBackground\nIn November 2021, ConstitutionDAO captivated the world by raising upwards of $47 million dollars in only a week, in order to bid on a private copy of the US Constitution. The event was a Schelling point, a shared realization that DAOs have the potential for greatness on an exponential scale.\n\nUnfortunately the transparency of the DAO's fundraising allowed for the counter bidders to know exactly the amount they were up against. Ken Griffin, owner of some of the most influential financial institutions in the world, outbid the grassroots movement.\n\nConstitutionDAO was a cultural moment and it sparked a rush of participation in DAOs and their governance.\nCase in point, PeopleDAO formed to incubate Web3 projects with a social good focus, carrying forward and reinterpreting both the memes and the orphaned governance token of ConstitutionDAO. Seeing how transparency undermined the bidding effort, Nucleo has been heads down building for a year to create private multisigs and the means to bid privately. These are only a few of the direct descendants of the ConstitutionDAO legacy, but there are more.\n\nThis November, Sotheby's announced the auction of the other privately held Constitution. PeopleDAO, Nucleo, Juicebox, and Aztec Network have banded together, learning from the lessons last year. We will use combination of public and private fundraising to hide our bidding ammo.\n\nThus UnumDAO is a spiritual \"ConstitutionDAO 2\", following through on our founding fathers(mothers) original mission: The Constitution is defined as a document representing and serving the people, and yet no original copy is governed by the public, like a symbol for all the ways democracy has fallen short of its promises. Buying the Constitution resonates with so many because it's only partially about the Constitution itself â€” it's also about believing in the dream of liberty and justice and realizing that, in this world of old money and value extraction, the only way the disenfranchised can live our ideals is if we pool our power.",

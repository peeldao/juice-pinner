  "description": "We decided to build a New Donation Platform, for the reason that the team of JB vetoed the bill to set an upper limit to JuiceBoxDao, so it seriously harms the benefit of our donators.\nMost of the community members voted yes while the team members voted no using the free tokens reserved when we donate.\nWe have more than 1 million JBX and we're totally disappointed.\nThe new donation platform will fork the JB code and run on chains like bsc, solana, etc...\nAnd a donation target will be set to make it possible for the donators to make money.\nThe team of the new platform will never veto the bill of community, it's a promise.\nPlease give us your email address when you donate, we will build an email group.\n",

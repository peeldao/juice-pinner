  "description": "Tai Chi Youth is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit charity founded in 1996 improving the lives of \"troubled youth\" in Utah.  Tai Chi Youth programs teaching Yang Tai Chi Chuan, Yoga, Meditation and Shaolin Kung Fu have been successful in improving the lives of students in elementary schools, middle schools, high schools, YMCA, YWCA, Los Angeles Parks & Recreation, Unitarian Church, Decker Lake Maximum Security Youth Prison, and several rehabilitation centers.

  "description": "Save My Daughter life Dao\n\n#SAVEMYDAUGHTERLIFEDAO #SMDLD\n\nHello everyone in the DAO/Web3/Blockchain world\n\nBy the time you read this, there may be skepticism, but I swear to God, what I write is my own experience, no deceit,...in such despair....I can only hope that you We can reach out for help... I hope I can get your help...\n\nHere's the thing, my daughter has leukemia and he was born with leukemia.\n\nBut this daughter, she is not my child...\n(During the 2020 epidemic two years ago, when I knew about this, I felt hopeless in my life, and even lost the meaning of life...Because I love my family and my child so much, she is not my own child... …. After half a year, I calmed down and walked out of this shadow and accepted it all. Maybe I believe that this is the test and arrangement given to me by God. Afterwards, I brought her up and accepted that she is my baby girl)\n\nIn the process of taking the child to see a doctor in March 2021, the doctor said that the child's blood was abnormal, and blood was not produced and circulated normally. So I took the child's blood for a blood test and found out that she had congenital thalassemia...that is leukemia...(leukemia is the uncontrolled growth of abnormal white blood cells which affects the production of normal blood cells in the bone marrow and Decreases the number of healthy mature cells. This can lead to anemia, compromised immune system, and bleeding problems)\n\nBecause my daughter was born to my ex and a boy who cheated on me, the two parties have mild thalassemia in the blood, which caused the child to suffer from leukemia... My daughter's bone marrow can't transfuse blood for herself... As a result, I need to go to the hospital for new blood transfusions every month, Only in order to maintain the blood circulation in the body... (However, during the monthly blood transfusion, it will affect the rejection of the new blood and the blood in her body.. If it goes on for a long time, it will cause organ hardening, and then lead to organ failure and death....( I am really sad, why should a little life go through this suffering?), but I will never give up...\n\nAlthough my daughter is not my biological child, I love her because it is a fate arranged by God. As a father, I must try my best to raise medical expenses, help my child get bone marrow, and complete the bone marrow transplant. . Give her a \"new life\". She is only 3 years old this year...born in 2019...she is such a cute little girl...I don't want her to just leave like this...\n\nThe current goal of the child's medical expenses is to raise 200,000 US dollars for medical expenses. The main expenses are to find a suitable bone marrow through the bone marrow center, hospital medical expenses and doctor expenses...\n\nI implore the family of DAO world and Web3 world and blockchain world to help me, I don't need much…\nI need your power of $20...and the support of 10,000 people so I can reach my goal. I hope to get your help...\n\nAny progress with my child in the future, I will report to all good people on Twitter.\nIt's a real thing...it happened to me too. Everyone should be very grateful for having a healthy body. For some people, coming into this world may be riddled with diseases... If you have a force, maybe a new life will be reborn in this world. Thank you for reading.. If you don’t make a donation It's okay, I appreciate you taking the time to read my heartfelt words.. I hope you can help me share it. Let more people cherish the people and lives around them.\n\n🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 Save My daughter Live Dao Thank you for your support God bless you...Thank you...🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻",

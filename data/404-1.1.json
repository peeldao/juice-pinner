Each donor will be able to add an unicursal of your own creation to this NFT. You can draw whatever you want on the kraft paper, you can change the appearance of the guy or even draw something brand new. Every change of the PoorGuy will be mint as NFT on opensea, and the ownership will be back to donor. The total fundraising is 1017 eth.",

  "description": "Helping Hands: Monkey Helpers for the Disabled was founded to raise and train capuchin monkeys to provide daily in-home assistance to people living with spinal cord injury or other mobility impairments.\n\nIn 2021, in part due to a hostile legal environment and advancing technology, Helping Hands made the difficult decision to cease their training/placement services. As a result, many of their monkeys are out of work.\n\nMONKEY RETIREMENT ARMY is raising funds to support post-service monkeys at the Monkey Living Center. 100% of funds contributed will go towards supporting post-service monkeys (except for the 2.5% Juicebox fee).\n\nVisit https://monkeyhelpers.org/ to meet the monkeys and learn more.",

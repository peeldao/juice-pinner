The platform is designed to solve for attributing onchain events to marketing campaigns segmented by each referrer.\n\nA problem that we encountered over the last year while working on 65+ content marketing campaigns which paid out ~800,000 to content creators. \n\nReferrers/Affiliates are able to discover project details alongside incentives & KPIs, copy their unique link, share with their audience & earn a token of the projects choice. \n\nAmpliFi enables permissionless, incentivised, performance based marketing at scale around any onchain KPI.\n\nAmpliFi is fully results based. No results onchain = no cost to to the project. \n\nReferrers/affiliates earn 90% of the campaign budget or commission (depending on campaign type) pro-rata. The remaining 10% is distributed to $veAMP(locked AMP-ETH  80/20 balancer pool tokens) holders.\n\nAmpliFi DAO is raising to:\n\nOver the next month - \n-hire another front end dev to speed up implementation of custom campaigns for several projects in our sales pipeline & continue to roll out features to the AmpliFi App.\n-Complete smart contracts for $veAMP\n-Provide initial liquidity for $AMP \n\nOver the next 6/12 months -\n\n-Create runway for establishing the DAO and paying contributors for their work in all areas needed to support AmpliFi's growth.\n\nThe full amount we are raising ($3m) is equal to 6% of total supply at an FDV of 50m.

  "name": "Protect Crypto from SEC Overreach: Ian Balina SEC Legal Offense Fund",
  "description": "The SEC's complaint against Mr. Balina is a big stretch on all counts, and Ian is fighting them on behalf of the whole crypto community. \n\nIan is fighting against SEC over-reach in 3 areas with major significance for crypto and all blockchain activity worldwide:\n\n1. Expansive definition of what is a security\n\n2. Power-grab over blockchain-related transactions globally when they occur outside the United States\n\n3. Claiming it is compensation when someone pays money to buy something at a discounted price\n\nIanâ€™s willingness to fight on behalf of the worldwide crypto and blockchain community is why he didn't settle with the SEC 10 months ago and is willing to take this case to the Supreme Court if needed. \n\nDue to the costly and exhaustive process ahead, an Ian Balina Legal Offense Fund has been created to assist with the legal costs. \n\nWe invite you to join in pushing back against SEC overreach.\n",

  "description": "Pooling money together to hire an animation artist or studio to create a fan-made clip of a Billie Eilish song using Crypto Coven witches as characters.\n\nThe idea is to choose the song, style and investment together based on how much we can pool. The project is configured in a way that any donation made can be taken back at any time by the payer, beware of gas though.\n\nWe'd love to do this with all members in the crypto coven and we might get there soon, but for now, we are starting small and trying to learn what is needed here.\n\nThis is not an official crypto coven initiative. We do not own the crypto coven witch used on the logo of this project.",

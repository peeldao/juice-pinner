  "description": "We are building worldâ€™s first decentralized functionally encrypted anonymous smart contract and private transaction platform for scalable decentralized applications codenamed Tunnel Cash. Tunnel Cash is an anonymity-centric cross-chain decentralized platform enabling non-custodial private transactions and anonymous smart contracts supporting private transactions with arbitrary amounts and shielded transfers as well as functionally encrypted general-purpose decentralized applications supporting multi-user inputs on Terra and EVM-compatible blockchains e.g. Ethereum, BSC, Avalanche and Polygon.\n\nTunnel Cash will enable functionally encrypted internet of blockchains where all data and agents hosted are encrypted and only authorized users will be able to query the encrypted data and agents to a granular level without decrypting those in the first place. This will disrupt business models of many monopoly-seeking corporations e.g. Amazon, Microsoft, Oracle, TCS etc. ",

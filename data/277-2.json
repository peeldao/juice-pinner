  "description": "TronzBank, Fully-Decentralized Privacy Wallet on Tron Network, shields your transfers based on Zero-knowledge Proof and Tronz Protocol. Tronz Protocol is the official-supported privacy protocol of Tron Network. For users, TronzBank is just like a regular wallet. Once you have put money into TronzBank, you can make shielded & secure transfers with others.\nTronzBank is live on TRON Mainnet but we team hope that it can be deployed on Ethereum which need community's donates to finish it.",

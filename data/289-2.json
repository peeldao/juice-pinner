  "description": "tl;dr We are making the world’s first Doge anime in partnership with the Doge NFT and Dogecoin Foundation. Contribute to our treasury. We'll take you to the moon. #DoOnlyGoodEveryday\n\n📝 STORY\nAs climate change wrecks havoc on Earth and forces humanity to migrate to the moon, Shiba longs to go to the moon to reunite with her owner. As the floodwater closes in on her, she meets a lonely Whale who agrees to help her cross the open sea to the last rocket leaving the blue planet. What adventure awaits them as the world they have known and loved comes to an end?\n\n“The Shiba and the Whale” is produced by BAFTA-winning filmmaker Ser En.\n\n✌️ 2 WORLD’S FIRSTS\n‘The Shiba and the Whale’ will be the world’s first fiction film to be based on an Internet meme and the world’s first fully fractionalised film.\n\n🪙 TOKENS OF APPRECIATION = TOA\nWhenever you contribute to our treasury, you will receive our governance tokens - TOA. TOA is redeemable for community-exclusive collectibles like toys, books and posters. TOA holders will also receive community-exclusive updates and vote on treasury proposals regarding how to grow the intellectual property (IP) of “The Shiba and the Whale”.\n\n🖼️ COLLECTIBLE FRAMES (COMING SOON!)\n“The Shiba and the Whale” is fractionalised into 10,000 unique Collectible Frames that tell one unified story when strung together in a sequence.\n\nA total of 800 Collectible Frames have been pre-bought by the Doge NFT and Dogecoin Foundation. We will reserve 1,000 Collectible Frames to reward participating creators. \n\nThe remaining 8,200 Collectible Frames will be given out as NFTs alongside TOA to our contributors.\n\nIf you contribute…\nΞ0.042 → Own 1 Frame [Supply: 4,000]:\n★ Invitations to holders-only screenings;\n★ Your name and a message of up to 144 characters in closing credits and official website;\n\nΞ0.42 → Own 1 Second (12 Frames) [Supply: 50]:\n★ Invitations to world premiere and regional screenings;\n★ Your name, a special thank-you and a message of up to 280 characters in closing credits and official website;\n\nΞ25.2 → Own 1 Minute (720 Frames) [Supply: 5]: \n★ 'Executive Producer' credit;\n★ Invitations to world premiere, international film festivals and gala screenings;\n★ Your name, a photo and a message of up to 420 characters in closing credits and official website.\n\n🗺️ ROADMAP\nOn our way to the moon, we will aim for 3 goalposts.\n\nTo help you remember them, picture a reverse traffic light 🚥\n🚩 #1: 142 ETH (~$200,000) 🟢\n🚩 #2: 269 ETH (~$375,000) 🟡\n🚩 #3: 4,242 ETH (~$6,000,000) 🔴\n\nLet's break them down.\n\n🚩 #1: 142 ETH (~$200,000)\n🟢 GO\nOnce we have 142 ETH in our treasury, we will immediately greenlight the production of “The Shiba and the Whale”. In 6 - 9 months, we will see a beautiful piece of cinematic art make history by being both the world's first fiction film to be based on an Internet meme and the world's first fully fractionalised film. We will take our animated film on a world tour, participating in international film festivals and organising screenings in major cities.\n\n🚩 #2: 269 ETH (~$375,000)\n🟡 YIELD\nAs we continue to grow our treasury, we will invite creators, artists and builders with significant presence beyond web3 to submit co-creation proposals to our community. Utilising the IP of \"The Shiba and the Whale\", they will create art, books, toys and more, and share them with their audiences. Our community will be able to vote on submissions and steward our treasury. When we hit 269 ETH in our treasury, we will formalise our co-creation programme by building tools and organising masterclasses for our community and beyond\n\n🚩 #3: 4,242 ETH (~$6,000,000)\n🔴 STOP ('CAUSE WE'RE ON FIRE 🔥)\nThe moment our treasury holds 4,242 ETH, we will temporarily pause contributions and cease the issuance of TOA. With this milestone, our community will have been well accustomed to the business of building and scaling intellectual property. Community infrastructure will be supported by constructive norms like regular reporting, feedback sessions and co-creation workshops. As such, we will start transitioning reputable members of our community, nominated and endorsed by their peers, into official roles that oversee future decisions on token issuance, reserve management and appointment of key team leaders.\n\nWhichever stage we are at, we will always abide by the code of DOGE - #DoOnlyGoodEveryday 🐶\n\n🚀 Are you ready to go to the moon with us?",

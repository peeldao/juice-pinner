  "description": "This is a project where you can direct funds from your project or directly contribute on combating climate change by the purchase and retirement of carbon credits.\n\nThe choice for the carbon offsetting initiative will be made after we achieve 1 ETH on the treasury and the exact strategy will be open for discussion.\n\nI'm creating this to facilitate my own transactions on this sense, but feel free to join the movement by redirecting a small percentage of your project to it or donating directly.",

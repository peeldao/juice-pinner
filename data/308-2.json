  "description": "Campers gather roundâ€¦we are Campfire, a digital and IRL gathering place for creators of music, culture builders, and future-thinkers from around the globe to collectively shape the music industry of tomorrow.\n\nAt Art Basel, Campfire hopes to cultivate a unique web3 music experience by providing a creative space for artists to commune and collaborate in a professional studio setting.\n\nAll music created will be minted to the blockchain in collaboration with our sponsorship partners. In addition, the sessions will be live streamed and token gated!\n\nOur minimum goal for this fundraise is 2-20 ETH. With just 2 ETH, we can rent an airbnb and convert it into a DIY studio using crowd-sourced equipment from our community. With 20 ETH, we can rent professional studio spaces and provide a top-of-the-line experience for our community of artists.\n\nFunds will be deployed for the following in order of priority:\n1) Recording studio + engineers\n2) Campfire team/artist accommodations \n3) Photography/Cinematography",

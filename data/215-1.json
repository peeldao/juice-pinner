  "description": "Loss DAO is initiated by a poor programmer living in Beijing. In 2021, the promoters have experienced 519 liquidation, 97 liquidation and October 27 liquidation, $Bunny was stolen and plummeted, the dragon slaying game project rug, the bnb hero project rug, $Eternal and The Wizards & Dragons Game were plummeted. I realized it is an impossiable mission to earn its cost, so I initiated the Loss DAO to earn its cost by community members' wisdom. Loss DAO hopes to bring together the power of the community and use the raised funds pool to establish a community-managed cryptocurrency fund. The use of funds is completely subject to community voting. Whether you want to buy a meme project like $people or make a value investment in some blockchain projects with greater potential in the future, you only need to initiate a vote and vote for it. ",

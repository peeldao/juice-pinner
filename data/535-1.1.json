  "description": "Help displaced families exchanging currency.\nWe are a small collective of individuals living near Ukraine border volunteering our time and resources to help refugees with the basics as they enter EU. \n\nOne of the big problems that refugees face after crossing the border is lack of cash, or to be precise, an ability to exchange their home currency Ukrainian Hrivnya for Euro or other local currencies.\n\nThe reason is that none of the banks in EU want to exchange Ukraine currency in any cash form!!! \n\nTo this date we have helped a few families by exchanging their Hrivnya banknotes (which could potentially be a useless pieces of paper) for Euros. Given our small groups limited financial resources, we have ran out of our own crypto donations that we kept turning into cash. This is a call to all of you who would like to help families to convert some of their on-hand cash while helping Ukraine currency to survive by hodling it. What will happen to the bank notes we buy will be decided HERE.",

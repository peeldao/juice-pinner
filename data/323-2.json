  "description": "YouniDAO is currently in the pursuit of curating the first tour that's exclusive to independent musicians. \n\nUni Fest will be an annual tour for local independent musicians, sponsored mainly by web3 people & projects. Uni Fest Summer 2023 will have 10-15 local musicians from each city perform for their local fan base, get paid, get resources and exposure.\n\nTemp Chek: a traveling crowdfund and onboard campaign, is currently in action until April 2023. The founders, Saiko & Brenna, are on the road visiting every city on the Uni Fest roster to gather resources & feedback, spread the word about Uni Fest, and educate around web3.\n\nThere are a few questions Temp Chek & Uni Fest are attempting to answer:\n\n1. What's the best way to create micro-markets around local musicians? \n\n2. Can we cultivate an entirely community-funded yearly tour?\n\n3. Can we give local independent musicians the \"Big Stage\" experience and exposure they need to kick-start their careers?\n\n",

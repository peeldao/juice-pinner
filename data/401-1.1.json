  "description": "While we are still excited about how blockchain can change the world, there is a poor woman on the other end of the chain, the mother of 8 children in Fengxian China. We will use the funds raised for more legal support and assistance. Because we have learned that there are a large number of cases of abduction and trafficking of women in the local, the local court even explicitly refuses the abducted women to divorce their husbands. Therefore, we hope to use the funds raised to form a professional legal aid team to provide legal counsel and defense team services. There will be many obstacles from the local officials. In the past official announcements, they lied and reversed right and wrong more than once. The state media chose to remain silent on this incident. Therefore, we choose to launch crowdfunding and reporting here, hoping that the whole world can pay attention to this event and participate in this rescue operation.",

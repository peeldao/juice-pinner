  "description": "The shutdown of ChainNews, the leading blockchain media in Chinese is a great loss for the Chinese crypto community. In order to overcome the information gap and language barrier, we have to have a new ChainNews, which is ChainNewsDAO.\n\nBy the principle of decentralization, ChainNewsDAO would not be re-organized as a China-based company, but a purely DAO organization focusing on content with good quality. ChainNewsDAO would organize a team of volunteers finding, translating and spreading articles. \n\nMoreover, ChainNewsDAO would cooperate with reseacch institute, media, KOL, communities to demonstrate and produce good content in time.\n\nBy holding token of ChainNewsDAO ($NEWS), holders would be eligible to view the newest content on the website of ChinaNewsDAO.\n\nContributors at Juicebox for ChainNewsDAO would be eligible for the airdrop of NFT issued by ChainNewsDAO soon.",

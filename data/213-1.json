  "description": "AerithDAO aims to foster community engagement within decentralized spaces by maintaining a presence of 'florists'; trusted members who actively contribute to Web3 communities as representatives of Aerith. \n\nWe hope to promote group cohesion and contribute to the growth of meaningful, inclusive, and colorful internal cultures by facilitating incentivized inter-DAO events.\n\nAspiring florists must first contribute internally to AerithDAO.\n\n\"But for some reason, they have no problem blooming here.\"",

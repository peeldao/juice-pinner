  "description": "Thumbs Up (Finance) is a writing project about crypto, creativity and commerce. I've written content for/about many of DeFi's best protocols from PoolTogether to Index Coop. I want to keep making content, further exploring complex crypto subjects from Web3 social to privacy, governance, scaling solutions and beyond. Unfortunately a lot of this content is hard to fund and I'm currently working entirely off my work laptop and with limited funds to spare to experiment. If I can raise money through Juicebox (and my custom Non-Fungible Patronage NFT), I can do so much more, and even find creative ways to reward holders of the NFT. Will you help me turn this passion project into a full time gig? ",

  "description": "A DAO for the average user. when the average player comes together it is a huge force and we are well placed to go beyond the whales and use our influence to bring real benefit to the average player fighting alone. Please stop being influenced by kol whale investment advice, small money players need a real community to bring everyone together. It's all ordinary people here, ordinary players, and whales can't join. Many people have great ideas, just because they don't have enough money to make it happen. Every member has the right to vote and the right to be in charge, we are the ones who are really in charge, we do it ourselves, trust me, it's cool",

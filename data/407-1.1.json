  "description": "Recently, users from the world's largest NFT exchange platform, OpenSea, are experiencing a loss of their NFT due to unknown hackers stealing and flipping high-valued NFTs. The reason for this hack is still unknown while OpenSea placed a red banner on the top of its website pointing “We are actively investigating rumors of an exploit associated with OpenSea related smart contracts. This appears to be a phishing attack originating outside of OpenSea's website. Do not click links outside of opensea.io.” We are sorry to hear about the loss of friends who lost NFT in this hacking activity and we understand it is disappointing and frustrating. Therefore, we would like to raise funds to help our friends to recover from the loss of their NFT. To further improve the attention of OpenSea to protect users, we would like you to tell your complaint when you donate.  like “FK OpenSea\"",

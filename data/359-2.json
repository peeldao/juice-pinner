  "description": "At the recommendation of the amazing Richard (rliriano ðŸ¦œ#8200), Livster (livster#4913) has set up this Juicebox to help fund the purchase of a used vehicle. \n\nSadly, her 2002 Volvo S60 (her name is Veronique) has problems that would cost more to fix than the value of the car, even though that car was really cute, she cannot be saved. For example, Liv has been driving around with no power steering, which is a great upper-body workout, but she's been told is extremely dangerous so she has stopped. \n\nLiv is looking to buy a used Honda CR-V or Civic with lower than 120,000 miles - a reliable, affordable option. The car market right now is nuts, and her budget is ~$15,000. \n\nAny and all donations would be appreciated. \n\nIn return, Liv offers: \n- The PoolTogether community can name her car \n- Weird memes curated for each donor, most likely including frogs\n- Eternal gratitude \n- Astrology chart readings \n- Virtual hugs",

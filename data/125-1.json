  "description": "道可Dao, 非常Dao. 名可Meme, 非常Meme.\n\"The divine law may be spoken of, but it is not the common law. Things may be named, but names are not the things.\"\nThis excerpt is the opening line of Tao Te Ching, the bible of Taoism written by the ancient Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu, which comically puns with the words DAO and Meme. Spread the meme to your friends if you are amused or bewildered by it!",

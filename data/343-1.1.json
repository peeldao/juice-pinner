  "description": "We’re raising funds to Make DAODenver Free to all ETHDenver attendees!\n\nDAOPlanet.org (prev. DAOists.xyz) is hosting DAODenver on Feb. 15 & 16, as part of ETHDenver’s “Buidl” week.\n\nWhen goal is reached ($250K) DAODenver is FREE (w/ ticket holders offered refunds – risk-free purchase now guarantees entry).\nIf goal is not met, all funds still go to reducing attendee costs.\n\nExcess funds go to DAOPlanet efforts helping people & organizations unlock their potential within Decentralized Autonomous Organizations. DAOPlanet’s vision is greater representation for individuals within communities, organizations, businesses, and the entire world — achieved through the integration and proliferation of DAO principles and Web3 tools.\n\nDAOPlanet tokens are for governance and utility within its community. Join our Discord: https://bit.ly/DAOPlanet\n\nDAOPlanet reserves right to mint native tokens such that tokens issued through this campaign equal no more than 15% of total tokens.",

  "description": "ECORISE is creating a Data-as-a-currency, geolocation NFT that represents property-, natural capital asset- and revenue value of every square meter of land.  Each NFT or batch of NFT will provide real world metadata that proves the value of the NFT e.g. social capital, governance model, property and carbon and eco-credit value.\n\nECORISE is creating a token currency that is backed by natural capital assets.  The value of fiat currency losing its value through money printing and inflation is concerning and inevitable. WEB3 provides us with the opportunity to reimagine a new economy and financial mechanisms.  Our goal is to have massive impact in reversing ecosystem destruction and resultant climate change.  To dis-incentivize resource extraction and instead incentivize and reward agricultural and ecosystem and restoration.  Landowners hold the key to mass planetary regeneration, we just need to align the financial mechanisms and provide funding for the work that must be done.  Connect big money to small landowners around the world through WEB3 tech is the solution.  Retail and institutional investors can easily partake in this new regenerative finance economy through access to crypto and nfts.",

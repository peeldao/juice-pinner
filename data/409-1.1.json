  "description": "PandaDAO seeks to reduce the control centralized organizations have over information, and instead put personal data into the hands of the people. We also aim to produce tools for DAOs, allowing more individuals to work full-time for this new type of organization. PandaDAO is more than just a decentralized media organization. We are developing new decentralized data systems and liberating internet products and human resources from Web2.",

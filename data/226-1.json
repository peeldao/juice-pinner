  "description": "We want to memorize the first-ever time bitcoin is traded with goods. We plan to buy a restaurant in three months, in Dublin Ireland, rename it Bitcoin Pizza. The contributor can get the share of net profit based on the portion of their contribution. The restaurant will also support the crypto pay and the customer can get a 10% discount for that. This aims to incorporate crypto into our daily life and facilitate the transition to a digital currency world.",

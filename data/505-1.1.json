  "description": "Raising funds for a safe haven bunker. 1,000,000 $Bunk = 1 Bed in the bunker. Bunker shape and size will be based on the amount of funds raised. The bunker will be an underground hive structured design, with the intent to survive nuclear fallout. Bunker will be stocked with 3 months of supplies per bed.(I know it seems like overkill, but luck favors the prepared.) Bunker construction will begin when we have a full count of every donor and required supplies list. Each donor will be allowed to vote on various additions/changes to the bunker while under construction. If we achieve our minimum goal, all excess funds will be used on improving the bunker with various amenities. Should we exceed the minimum goal by a large enough amount, I have an idea for a near indestructible survival ark.\n",

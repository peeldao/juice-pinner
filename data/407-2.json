IF YOU CONTRIBUTE PLEASE JOIN THE TELEGRAM CHAT TO DISCUSS - https://t.me/+-XjZMgM2u1U0NmYx\n\nMetamorphic is an immersive 3D/VR album journey that pushes the boundaries of installation art, experience, and the album format itself. Recorded, produced, mixed, and mastered by DAILLY in a purpose-built studio in London between 2018-2022.\n\n10 Album Editions, each containing 10 Songs for a total supply of 100 Songs. Each Song is presented as an immersive 3D & VR installation in a bespoke gallery & theater space.\n\nIf we raise 10 ETH we will purchase an album which includes one 1/1 album token and 10 Metamorphic Song editions - each of which contains a unique gallery and theater space to enjoy the first-of-its-kind album experience. All funds will be withdrawn to a multi-sig which will complete the purchase. All contributors will share ownership and access to the purchased pieces.",

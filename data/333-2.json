  "description": "This is a crowdfund that will in turn be funded out to other members of the Ecosystem.  I've been racking my brain listening to people over the last 3 months listening to people who have been struggling while working for DAO projects.  \n\nWe've been able to crowdfund sending people to space, we've been able to send people to find SBF, and we've been able to crowdfund for people to buy the constitution. \n\nHave we been able to find ways to crowdfund for people who are struggling to make ends meet via Web3?  Not as much.\n\nI want to figure out how to help people who need to make it through the Holidays, through inflation, and through the struggles of making it in this new world. \n\n\nWith an ultimate goal of finding a way to help as many people as possible just try to get by while they pursue their dreams in DAOs and Web3, I realize that I don't have enough money to help people in the way that I want to. \n\nI'm reaching out to others, to crowdfund into a multi sig, and in turn, have the community decide on the first person to receive the proceeds from the fund. \n\nThe Goal is to reach 5000 dollars for round 1.  5 % will go stay in the Multi Sig to help fund round 2.  95 percent will go to the winner of the community vote. \n\nAs this project continues, every person who donates to the fund will be updated on events surrounding the project as it progresses. \n\nThank you all.",

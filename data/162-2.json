  "description": "Much of what has been said about the monetary system and its theories was developed when money was fully or partially backed by some type of commodity. There is no commodity money now, only debt money. The beautiful people who make up the world should not be deceived anymore, they should have an economy of their own. Most people cannot think clearly and get lost in daily economic life. It's up to us engineers to help them.\nToday, thanks to this token project, we aim to help people with an algorithm that measures the status of other tokens and calculates whether they are \"OKE\" or not, by breaking new ground among cryptocurrencies.\nGreetings from New York to all the beautiful people...\n\n4 Engineer Brothers (MIT) live in NY 11th Str , Say \"OKEY! WE ARE READY! to MAKE You Rich of Life...\"\n***Token for 7.97 Billion People of The World!***\n",

  "name": "The Shiba and the Whale - A Doge Anime",
  "description": "We are making the world’s first Doge anime in partnership with the Doge NFT and Dogecoin Foundation. Contribute to our treasury. Let's complete the Doge anime in time to show the Doge. Yes, she's still alive and well, and she deserves to see her anime ✨\n\n📝 STORY\nAs climate change wrecks havoc on Earth and forces humanity to migrate to the moon, Shiba longs to go to the moon to reunite with her owner. As the floodwater closes in on her, she meets a lonely Whale who agrees to help her cross the open sea to the last rocket leaving the blue planet. What adventure awaits them as the world they have known and loved comes to an end?\n\nWatch our trailer: https://www.shibaandwhale.com/trailer\n\n👋 ABOUT US\n“The Shiba and the Whale” is produced by BAFTA-winning filmmaker Ser En. Together we are 「Mecenia」 a.k.a The People’s Studio - an NFT-to-film studio helmed by award-winning filmmakers, media execs and web3 builders that take memes way too seriously.\n\nOur name was inspired by Gaius Maecenas, a patron for Ancient Roman poets such as Horace and Virgil. His name became synonymous to patrons of the arts in many European languages, including French, Spanish, Italian, German and Dutch.\n\n✌️ 2 WORLD’S FIRSTS\n‘The Shiba and the Whale’ will be the world’s first fiction film to be based on an Internet meme and the world’s first fully fractionalised film, comprising 10,000 Collectible Frames.\n\n🪙 TOKENS OF APPRECIATION = TOA (Ṫ)\nWhen you contribute to our treasury, you will receive our governance tokens - TOA. TOA is redeemable for community-exclusive collectibles like toys, books and posters. TOA holders will also receive special updates and vote on treasury proposals regarding how to develop the intellectual property (IP) of “The Shiba and the Whale”.\n\nOur symbol is Ṫ because it looks like a human who welcomes you with open arms. \n\n🖼️ COLLECTIBLE FRAMES\n“The Shiba and the Whale” is fractionalised into 10,000 unique Collectible Frames that tell one unified story when strung together in a sequence.\n\nA total of 800 Collectible Frames have been pre-bought by the Doge NFT and Dogecoin Foundation. We will reserve 1,000 Collectible Frames to reward participating creators. \n\nThe remaining 8,200 Collectible Frames will be given out to our contributors as Unlockable NFTs.\n\nIf you contribute…\nΞ0.042 → Own 1 Frame [Supply: 2,200]:\n★ Invitations to holders-only screenings;\n★ Your name in closing credits and official website;\n\nΞ0.42 → Own 1 Second (12 Frames) [Supply: 200]:\n★ Invitations to holders-only screenings;\n★ Your name and a message of up to 280 characters in closing credits and official website;\n\nΞ25.2 → Own 1 Minute (720 Frames) [Supply: 5]: \n★ 「Executive Producer」 credit;\n★ Invitations to world premiere, international film festivals and gala screenings;\n★ Your name, a photo and a message of up to 420 characters in closing credits and official website.\n\n🗺️ ROADMAP\nOn our way to the moon, we will aim for 3 goalposts.\n\nTo help you remember them, picture a reverse traffic light 🚥\n🚩 #1: Ξ142 (~$200,000) 🟢\n🚩 #2: Ξ269 (~$375,000) 🟡\n🚩 #3: Ξ4,242 (~$6,000,000) 🔴\n\nLet's break them down.\n\n🚩 #1: Ξ142 (~$200,000)\n🟢 GO\nOnce we have Ξ142 in our treasury, we will immediately greenlight the production of “The Shiba and the Whale”. In 6 - 9 months, we will see a beautiful piece of cinematic art make history by being both the world's first fiction film to be based on an Internet meme and the world's first fully fractionalised film. We will take our animated film on a world tour, participating in international film festivals and organising screenings in major cities.\n\n🚩 #2: Ξ269 (~$375,000)\n🟡 YIELD\nAs we continue to grow our treasury, we will invite creators, artists and builders with significant presence beyond web3 to submit co-creation proposals to our community. Utilising the IP of \"The Shiba and the Whale\", they will create art, books, toys and more, and share them with their audiences. Our community will be able to vote on submissions and steward our treasury. When we hit Ξ269 in our treasury, we will formalise our co-creation programme by building tools and organising masterclasses for our community and beyond\n\n🚩 #3: Ξ4,242 (~$6,000,000)\n🔴 STOP ('CAUSE WE'RE ON FIRE 🔥)\nThe moment our treasury holds Ξ4,242, we will temporarily pause contributions and cease the issuance of TOA. With this milestone, our community will have been well accustomed to the business of building and scaling intellectual property. Community infrastructure will be supported by constructive norms like regular reporting, feedback sessions and co-creation workshops. As such, we will start transitioning reputable members of our community, nominated and endorsed by their peers, into official roles that oversee future decisions on token issuance, reserve management and appointment of key team leaders.\n\nWhichever stage we are at, we will always abide by the code of DOGE - #DoOnlyGoodEveryday 🐶\n\n🚀 Are you ready to go to the moon with us?",

  "description": "All inhabitants of teh nests that exists now in our ecosystem, and those that will exist, must unite together and soar with one flock. A truly decentralized world can only be built with the might of all our wings flapping together, creating a wind that will be felt by all. CrowDAO seeks to fulfill this mission by becoming an open sanctuary for all brave and brilliant birds, where they can collaborate to create a stronger, more connected ecosystem. This IS the vision.",

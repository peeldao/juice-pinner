  "name": "K.Group DAO",
  "description": "Our mission is to help solve the affordable housing crisis by converting residential properties into Shared Living Spaces. K.Group DAO is raising funds to acquire single family, and multifamily properties. Once acquired our construction team converts these properties into multi room units. By converting the properties, we are able to allow additional tenants to stay at the property for a cheaper rent. Not only does this allow low income families to afford better housing, but it gives them a chance to become financially stable. All assets are purchased under the K.Group DAO LLC entity formed in Wyoming, which is controlled by the minted juicebox smart contract. Governance is controlled by the $KDAO Token. Let's grow our DAO and put a huge dent in the Affordable Housing Crisis.",

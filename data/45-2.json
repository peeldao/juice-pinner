  "description": "Hundreds of billions of dollars in assets are reduced to ashes as the bear market in the currency circle arrives in May 2022. To commemorate the historic occasion, a takeaway collection from McDonald's punk collectors is unveiled. This project is a community autonomy project initiated by early cypherpunk NFT collectors to buy McDonald's NF. Currently, you can buy McDonald's punks on Opensea. If Opensea is too expensive, you can also raise money to buy it. If the price on Opensea is too low, it will be held in large quantities and the proceeds will be returned to the community. As long as you hold FFP , you indirectly hold McDonald's punk, and part of the funds raised will be used to buy collector's edition McDonald's punk.",

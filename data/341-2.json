  "description": "Crypto needs heroes to defend against government overreach that seeks to destroy what we build. Buy a FIGHT token and you can own a piece of the victory as my think tank sues the SEC, OFAC, IRS and bank regulators. The proceeds of this sale will be used by The Crypto Freedom Lab, a 501(c)3 think tank, to fund litigation against agencies of the US Federal government, including the SEC, IRS, OFAC and bank regulators who threaten crypto innovators. As a securities law professor, former SEC advisor, and former Congressional Committee Counsel I believe I have a unique skill set to lead this fight. All proceeds will be used to support litigation and other formal action against government regulator overreach. Read more about this project and my bio at www.cryptofreedomlab.com.

  "description": "$FEVM holders are in the driver's seat of the Fédération Decentrale de EVM, or FDE. The governing body of the Formula EVM World Wide Web3 Championships; An experiment in DAO gamification and token-based community inspired by the spectacle, sportsmanship, and team camaraderie of Formula 1. \n\nFDE members will write the rule book, or \"Formula\" for each season of competition as well as receive front-of-grid access to our upcoming NFT releases, including those required to join the competition.  \n\nThis is the FEVM Formation Fund campaign... Our public sale of $FEVM governance tokens. We are aiming to raise a total of 1,950 ETH to fund this ambitious long-term project. The funds will be used to develop, promote, and launch the inaugural FEVM championship season in tandem with the 2023 F1 season. Any funds raised beyond the goal will be used to reward engaged DAO members with priceless motorsport prizes and experiences.\n\nPlus, every serious FDE member who holds 50k+ $FEVM will be airdropped a Race Steward NFT which grants them additional DAO privileges, and a guaranteed WL spot on all our forthcoming NFT mints.\n\nPurchase $FEVM to join.

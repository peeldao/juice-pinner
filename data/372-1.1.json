  "description": "Fake Internet Money is buying up the entire supply of Steve Pikelny's incredible collection, \"Fake Internet Money\" created for ArtBlocks.\n\nThe goal is to make the collection of this artwork a reserve currency of the world. \n\nNot only is the artwork incredibly detailed, meticulously created, but conceptually it is the strongest work produced yet in the digital space on the intangible hypocrisy of the concept of monetary value. \n\nBy amassing an enormous collection of Fake Internet Money, we will simultaneously make it \"real\". \n\nSee: https://www.artblocks.io/project/152",

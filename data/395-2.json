  "description": "Crypto Underworld Podcast comes from the AFA/LCD discussions breaking down the scams we find and investigating how they work and who are behind them. \nWe think there is a massive disservice to the crypto community and new users to not have an easy place to listen in for \"buyer beware\" verbose as well as coverage on crypto fundamentals, self-regulation, and everything in-between. \nNo shilling projects, no covering the price of BTC day to day, just pure talk and a few guests here and there!",

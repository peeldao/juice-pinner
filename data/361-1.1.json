  "description": "KillAssangeDAO takes a stance against AssangeDAO's views.\nJulian Assange does not deserve to be rescued.\nAssangeDAO, a crypto punk team, is doing something against humanity.\nWe will raise ETH in exchange for $UNFAIR to help the opposing defense team make this defense moot.\nIf money can tamper with the law to get evil people off the hook, then we're going to take up the weapon of money to reshape justice too.",

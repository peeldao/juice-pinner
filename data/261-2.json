  "description": "There are residents of Detroit, Michigan that are struggling in silence. Many of them live among us and we pass them every day. This treasury will be built for the following: Food pantries, Legal aid, transportation, Job creation, and safety for neighborhoods. As time progresses we will either add, remove or change what the assets will be used for. Education in finance will also be a part of this progression moving forward. Website and social links will be added shortly.",

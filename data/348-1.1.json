  "description": "Tired of project after project that makes you mint a bunch of pointless png images?\nWe have a chance to change this\n1. Unless an NFT with high artistic value, it should be just a token to verify identity.\n2. We create a token with no artistic value to verify your identity, all the value will be created by the community.\n3. 100% of all income after deducting costs are placed in the community multi-signature wallet, so the operation of funds is left to the community to decide. Whether we want to go to the moon, buy land or invest.",

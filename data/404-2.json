  "description": "Join the livestream: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlFVZBe9-DM\n\nBasedAF aims to become the native entertainment brand of the Metaverse through jaw-dropping stunts and challenges to rival the top creators on YouTube.\n\nFor our first major event, SuperMassive (@IamSupermassive), is running a marathon in the Metaverse to raise money for Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital. \n\nAnd here’s the twist: if we can raise $100k before SuperMassive completes the marathon, then we get to send him right back to the starting line. \n\nAnd yep, he’ll have to do it all over again. Why? Because why the hell not. \n\nWeb3 has earned a pretty bad reputation this year. And not without reason. Today, we have a chance to showcase the best of the space by coming together for a cause bigger than ourselves. \n\nAnd maybe, just maybe, show the skeptics that the Metaverse should (and can!) be a force for positive change. \n\nBasedAF’s official event sponsors, Fantom(@FantomFDN), have generously offered to match your donations up to $50k. Meaning we need to raise $50k to get us to our $100k target for Great Ormond Street Hospital. \n \nFollow @we_are_BasedAF for the latest updates and join discord.com/basedAF to partake in the fun. Fun for everyone except SuperMassive, that is.",

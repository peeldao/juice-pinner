  "description": "We're buying a former Boy Scouts Ranch to turn into a Crypto Commons $CAMPus - the first step towards our vision of a network of nature-based $CAMPuses for grassroots land stewardship, regenerative culture and economic empowerment. Come $CAMP with us! Our flagship $CAMPus, which we are currently in negotiations to acquire, is located on the West Coast, within striking distance of a major city. Contribute to the $CAMP “Peace Chest” to become a founding $CAMPer. You’ll have premium access to the land we acquire, a say in its governance, development, and future acquisitions by the Crypto Commons DAO. Now is the time - local Boy Scouts Councils (and others) are selling nature-based campuses all around the United States, that soon may be inaccessible to the general public. Join us in helping to maintain nature-based access and learning for all ages, for generations to come! $CAMP is initiated and stewarded by the @futurescouts and @commonsengine.",

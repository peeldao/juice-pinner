  "description": "Save Do Kwon!\nThe warrant issued by the Korean government has completely violated what blockchain represents for. \nThe DAO will be contributed for the purpose of hiring superior attorneys as well as any bail fees if required by Do Kwon.\nThis is not just a protest from blockchain but also an revolution against the centralized governments!\n\nWe have been in touch with Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) in regards to specific schemes on saving Do Kwon, and raised funds from serval communities. The birth of Bitcoin was where blockchain starts its revolution, and we are the next savior.\n\nThe warrant issued by the Korean government has completely violated what blockchain represents for. \nThe DAO will be contributed for the purpose of hiring superior attorneys as well as any bail fees if required by Do Kwon.\nThis is not just a protest from blockchain but also a revolution against the centralized governments!\n",

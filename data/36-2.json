  "description": "Have you ever wondered: “How cool would it be to have one of the biggest, fastest, and most expensive car collections in the world?” Well, unless you are Jay Leno, Floyd Mayweather, Ralph Lauren, or Manny Khoshbin, it is most likely that most of us can’t afford to own a collection of the most insane cars ever produced. However, with the power of Web3, consumers finally have the capability to collectively own and coordinate at scale. We at Midnight Racing Club want to bring auto racing fans all over the world together to build a first ever fan-owned collection of past and present Formula One and exotic cars. We will outline our vision, explore different approaches, and offer what we think to be the best authentic and immersive experience for auto racing enthusiasts.",

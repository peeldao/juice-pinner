  "description": "We are planning to buy an island around the Caribbean Sea to build a Kingdom of Web3!\nEveryone's web3 address is his only identification on the island. Cryptocurrency is the only legal currency. The island will be divided into different areas according to different chain ecology for different people.\nWe will also build a corresponding island on Decentraland and update them synchronously, so that people from all over the world can see the development of the island and interact with various facilities on the island without going to the island in person. When choosing an island, we took into account its geographic location, existing infrastructure --after all, building an island from zero would be very expensive--and the size of the island, then we chose Cave Way which is an 220 Acre Private Island positioned in the Exuma Cays immediately north of Musha Cay, Exuma. Cave Cay owns deep-water harbour and completely self-sufficient utilities underground including water and power supply.",

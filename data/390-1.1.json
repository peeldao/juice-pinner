  "description": "This short film, follows the downward spiral of a friendship between two military recruits, David and Warri, as each struggles to survive training at an isolated Nigerian boot camp in the desert and during the Harmattan (dry) season. The camp’s only source and reserve of water is an old well - a deep pit, an abyss that Warri claims “can lead you to the bush of ghosts”. After Warri fails to convince David to run away from camp; the well-sustaining camp mysteriously dries up. A soldier is then sent by car to bring help from the nearest town, leaving the recruits who remain to continue their training with no water.  For the next two days, David and Warri struggle to survive the devilish training administered by the Drill Sergeant. Tensions quickly rise, sending everyone to the brink of their sanity. Warri finds a mysterious necklace that leads him to meet an equally mysterious ethereal young woman at the well and combined with the ongoing jealousy growing between the two leads to death.",
